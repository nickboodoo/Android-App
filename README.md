Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app required users to be able to log into a database and edit/add/remove items from an inventory. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A database, inventory and login screens were necessary for this application.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I used the CRUD techniques to design my code and I will continue to use CRUD to develop code. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I performed tests regularly on my code so that I would know that it was functional. If my test revealed that I had a mistake, I tried my best to resolve the issue. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate when I ran into issues that I need to fix. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think that my UI/UX design was the best part of this project since I am currently in a UI/UX class and it was fresh.
