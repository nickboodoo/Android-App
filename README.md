# Inventory App

I made an android app that allows users to log into a database and edit/add/remove items from an inventory.  If my test revealed that I had a mistake, I tried my best to resolve the issue. I decided to make this app to test out my android app development skills as well as some database/frontend skills. 

I performed tests regularly on my code so that I would know that it was functional.
